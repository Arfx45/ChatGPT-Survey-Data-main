# ChatGPT Usage Analysis - Ethics Class Project
This project was undertaken as part of our Ethics in Technology class to explore the usage patterns of AI tools like ChatGPT among students. The goal was to ethically collect and analyze student data, ensuring privacy and consent, and to present insights using Python and its data analysis libraries.

Project Overview
Objective
To analyze and visualize student usage patterns of ChatGPT while addressing ethical concerns such as data privacy, informed consent, and transparency.

Data Collection
We designed a survey to gather anonymized data from students about:

Frequency of ChatGPT usage
Purpose (e.g., assignments, coding, general queries, etc.)
Perceived benefits and drawbacks
Ethical concerns regarding AI tools
The collected data was anonymized to protect student identities.

Tools and Libraries
This project leveraged several Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations.
Seaborn: To generate more advanced and aesthetically pleasing plots.
Numpy: For numerical computations and data handling.
Jupyter Notebooks: For an interactive environment to code, visualize, and present our findings.
Features
Data Cleaning and Organization

Removal of duplicates and handling missing values.
Standardization of categorical data.
Descriptive Statistics

Calculation of averages, medians, and usage trends.
Visualizations

Bar charts showing frequency of usage across different demographics.
Pie charts for purposes of usage.


Insights into how students perceive the ethical implications of using ChatGPT, summarized into visual reports.
Ethical Considerations
Informed Consent: Students were informed about the purpose of the survey, and participation was voluntary.
Data Anonymization: All collected data was anonymized to ensure privacy.
Transparency: Findings were shared openly with participants and stakeholders.
